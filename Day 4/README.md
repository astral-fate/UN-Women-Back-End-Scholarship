### Tips and tricks 

To write a comment, wither with HTML or with PHP, we can select our intended text then click ctrl+/
and automatically the vc code editor will recogiize the stnatx, and uses the appropiate comment syntax.


## Switch Statmen
Switch is not commonly used, however it's best to fimilirize ourself with its syntax.

#### Example:


### While Loop

While loop works as a for loop, and its synatx is as followed:
````
$x=1;
while($x<=5){
  $x++;
  echo 'the number is:' . $x;
  }
````

### Do While Loop

The main diffrences between while loop and do-while loop, is that the 2nd print the condition at least one, whereas while loop dose not.

#### Example:
````
$x=10;
do{
  echo 'the number is:' . $x;
  $x++;
  }
while($x>100);
````

This will print the value of x even if the condition is not satsified. 

### HTML example on While Loop
