### Tips and tricks 

For security reason it's not advided to use '$_SERVER' because it allows all urls to be executed. To resolce this we can use instead

## GLOBALS
Switch is not commonly used, however it's best to fimilirize ourself with its syntax.

#### Example:


## While Loop

While loop works as a for loop, and its synatx is as followed:
````
$x=1;
while($x<=5){
  $x++;
  echo 'the number is:' . $x;
  }
````

## Do While Loop

The main diffrences between while loop and do-while loop, is that the 2nd print the condition at least one, whereas while loop dose not.

#### Example:
````
$x=10;
do{
  echo 'the number is:' . $x;
  $x++;
  }
while($x>100);
````

This will print the value of x even if the condition is not satsified.
